1. Explain what is a cluster and what is a hadoop cluster

Clusters are group of systems taht performs a specific task which will act as a single system.In a computer system, a cluster is a group of
servers and other resources that act like a single system and enable high availability and, in some cases, load balancing and parallel
processing. 

A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured 
data in a distributed computing environment.one machine will be name node and other machines will be job tracker.the rest will act as data
node and task tracker.And they are mainly used for boosting the speed of the process.



2.What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster

        Rack is a place where all the nodes will be arranged.And a rack can store upto 30-40 nodes together.And with the help of a switch the 
 racks can be connected together in a network.And the main purpose of rack is to minimize the network traffic.for the process of
writing and reading files namenode will pick the node which are closer in a same rack.because when the nodes are of same rack then 
 transmission will be more efficient than the nodes in different racks.
 
        Name node will have the reack information by by mainataining rack id's of each node.one can place replica in a rack.by placing
 replica losing of data can be minimized when the node fails by using the bandwidth of teh node.and there is a restriction than
not more than one replica can be placed in asingle node and not more than two in a rack.by defaul hadoo installation will assume that 
all nodes belong to a same rack.
