1. Explain what is a cluster and what is a hadoop cluster

        Clusters are group of computers connected together and which act as a single system which are connected by means of a LAN.these clusters
act as a single one which has a higher speed and a huge storage capacity.but inn case of maintainance and cost it is costly and not easy to
maintain.

        In contrast Hadoop is a special type of cluster which is more similar but ost wise it is not much expensive where a huge pile of 
unstructered data can be stored in a distributed format.where one machine will act as name node and others will perform the process of job 
tracker.whereas there will be a system acting as data node and other systems as task tracker.and it's mainly done for boosting up of speed.
most of teh process will be done by worker nodes whose job is to store data and to run the process.the process of worker node is to
run the datanodew and tasktracker which communicate with the master node and helps to receive the information.



2.What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster

        Rack is a place where all the nodes will be arranged.And a rack can store upto 30-40 nodes together.And with the help of a switch the 
 racks can be connected together in a network.And the main purpose of rack is to minimize the network traffic.for the process of
writing and reading files namenode will pick the node which are closer in a same rack.because when the nodes are of same rack then 
 transmission will be more efficient than the nodes in different racks.
 
        Name node will have the reack information by by mainataining rack id's of each node.one can place replica in a rack.by placing
 replica losing of data can be minimized when the node fails by using the bandwidth of the node.and there is a restriction than
not more than one replica can be placed in a single node and not more than two in a rack.by defaul hadoo installation will assume that 
all nodes belong to a same rack.

        It is already said tha all the data will have a replica intwo other places.and the pipeline is made of three datanodes.first datanode
will be chosen and he second one will chosen in random and the one near the first datanode has more chance to be chosen as the second data node.
and pipeline will be from second to third node.
        
        After the write process have been completed,the packets are sent from thirdDatanode will send acknowledgement to the second 
DataNode and then will be passed form the second towards first later to the client datanode.and this is a repeated process for all the 
files in a block.and every file will have its replica in any of two racks.After the written process gets done by the client acknowlegement will be 
done which will inform that the written process is over.as well the namenode will check whethere there is a minimal replication for each
blocks.
